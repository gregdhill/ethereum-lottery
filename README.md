# Smart Lottery - Ethereum

This was built for a module on blockchains at the University of Edinburgh. The specification required that students design and implement a smart contract that exchanges ether for custom tokens, then transfers all funds to a randomly selected participant once a pre-defined threshold is hit. After careful analysis, several improvements were made to incentivise participants and minimize unnecessary gas costs.

To run either solution:
1. Open '.sol' in [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/).
2. Connect to account / blockchain.
3. Compile and launch.
